# Custom E-Commerce

This repository contains the setup for a MERN stack-based e-commerce project, designed to demonstrate
how to integrate the backend and frontend with Tailwind CSS for styling.It includes the configuration
of necessary dependencies, backend and frontend scripts, and database integration using MongoDB.

## 📋 Summary

In this project, we set up a full-stack e-commerce application using
the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The main highlights of the setup process include:

- **Project Setup:** We created the project folder and initialized it in the terminal.
- **Dependency Installation:** Installed essential backend and frontend packages using npm.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Integrated Tailwind CSS for fast and flexible UI styling.
- **Script Configuration:** Added scripts in `package.json` to run the backend and frontend servers.
- **Folder Structure:** Organized the backend into directories like `config`,
`controllers`, and `models` for maintainability.
- **Database Connection:** Configured Mongoose to connect to MongoDB and
used environment variables for sensitive data.
- **Server Initialization:** Successfully started both the backend and
frontend servers to ensure smooth communication.

## 🔑 Key Insights

- **Efficient Project Management:** By creating clear folder structures and
organizing scripts, the project becomes easier to manage, navigate, and scale.
- **Dependency Awareness:** Installing packages like JWT for authentication
ensures security and improves overall performance.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS provides flexibility in UI design,
allowing for rapid changes without needing to write extensive CSS code.
- **Version Control:** Regularly updating project dependencies ensures
the application remains secure and up-to-date.
- **Environment Variables:** The use of `.env` files keeps sensitive
data secure and provides easy configuration options.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing try-catch blocks in database connections
helps in debugging and prevents application crashes.
- **Interconnected Architecture:** Running both the backend and frontend
servers concurrently demonstrates the integration of a full-stack solution.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- MongoDB instance or cloud database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- Basic understanding of MERN stack

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajeevkavala/Custom_E-Commerce.git
   cd Custom_E-Commerce
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables (`.env`):
   - `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT authentication.

5. Start the backend and frontend servers:

   **Backend (API Server)**:
   ```bash
   npm run index.js
   ```

   **Frontend (React Server)**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   to view the application.
